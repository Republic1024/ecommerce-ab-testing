## 🚨 Strategic Recommendations

### 🎯 **Immediate Business Actions**

1. **Adopt Advertisement Strategy**

   * Strong evidence supports ads as superior to PSA for conversions.
   * Phased rollout recommended: 25% → 50% → 100%.

2. **Optimize Ad Exposure**

   * Focus budget on **high-exposure segments** (>20 ads) where effect is strongest.
   * Monitor for diminishing returns and ad fatigue.

3. **Time-based Targeting**

   * Allocate more impressions to **Afternoon/Evening slots**, maximizing conversion efficiency.
